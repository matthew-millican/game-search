# Game Search 

## Purpose

This was one of my third-year projects in the module Artificial Intelligence (CS3105) at the University of St. Andrews.

The 3 parts to the project was to:

1. Implement a solution checker for a variant of solitaire.

2. Implement a depth-first search algorithm to solve this solitaire variant.

3. Implement a depth-first search algorithm of this another solitaire variant called Worm-hole.

An analysis and evaluation of the algorithms is provided in the report and some graphs are constructed using matplotlib. 

JUnit tests are used to run the algorithms a variety of times, and store the results that can then be analysed.

## How To Run

A makefile is included in the src repository which contains all the instructions on how to run the variety  of programs.
